3\. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
---------------------------------------------------------------

**In Short:** We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like
with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate
business interests.

**If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely
on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

* **Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your
  consent
  at any time. Learn more about [withdrawing your consent](#withdrawconsent).

* **Legal Obligations.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement
  body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.


* **Vital Interests.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations
  involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

**_If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you._**

your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can [withdraw your consent](#withdrawconsent) at any time.

* For business transactions provided certain conditions are met

* If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim

* If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records

permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
until deletion is possible.



6\. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
-----------------------------------------

**_In Short:_** We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,
despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure,
so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal,
or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If
you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at dpo@viperrtp.com.

have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country,
province, or state of residence.

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and
obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data
portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to

you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact)" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your
personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at privacy@viperrtp.com.



9\. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
--------------------------------------

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT
signals, we do not respond to them at this time.



10\. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?
-------------------------------------------------------------

**_In Short:_** If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
